% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%

% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ffffff%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%The discovery of the Electromyogram (EMG) signal was in 1666, when the Italian "Francesco Redi" has shown that the muscle can generate an electric current. After two centuries,  in 1849, the German-French researcher "Dubois-Reymond" was the first whom realized the first record of an EMG signal.

%The EMG signal is generated as a result of a depolarization followed by a repolarization that happen at the entrance of the sodium in the interior of the cell membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber, and release potassium to the outside. ~\cite{Konte}. \par

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The EMG signal provides an intelligent and natural way of a human machine interaction, which can be a good solution to replace conventional controls interfaces and allows some categories of users the opportunity to exploit the new technologies.
In augmented reality, by implanting electrodes in different ways in the human body, especialy in his feets, legs, arms, hands, and his face we can create a virtual human user, witch has a total control of his body members.
We can find the EMG technology in the Control Command field. In nuclear power plants or in the big factories, for some critical and dangerous tasks emploies use EMG-based robots, witch allows more security and safety.
The EMG technology is used also in biomedical field, gaming field, 3D animations and human-machine interfaces field.\par
Amputation and deformity have been dealt with, one way or
another, throughout the ages. More than one million individuals in the United States today are living with limb 
amputations ~\cite{Patricia}, in which there are thousands patients with an upper limb amputation.
According to~\cite{China} approximately 8\% of physical disables, or 2.26 million people,
live with limb amputations in China alone. Natural disasters and accidents have been making this number increase. For this reason, over the years many searchers 
have focused on the creation of artificial limbs and the realisation of Human Machine interfaces controled by the EMG signal, which can be one of the most interesting solutions. 
The use of EMG is not limited, which is explained by the diversity of the applications that we can be found today.
\par

\par
%Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity, is realized by using an instrument called an electromyograph, to produce a record called an electromyogram. \par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%fffff%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Several researches and applications have treated the EMG signals. In fact, numerous studies have been made on classifications and treatments of it. for instance, on facial expressions recognition by analyzing physiological signals, on detection and identification of the uterine EMG signal for prediction of premature child-birth.
Our study is focused on the EMG signals generated by a human hand or arm.  We aim to develop an application that controls a set of media, using the EMG signal with arm force. The electrical potential generated during a contraction of an arm muscles permits to start a video or switch between a set of media. Our proposed system has been developed in the purpose of creating an EMG-based remote control that allows more simplicity to use than the classical methods, especially for helping people with reduced mobility.


The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews relevant related work and different existing approaches for exploiting the EMG signals. Section~\ref{sec:proposedapproach} presents our approach for using the EMG signals to take control over a multimedia application, and we present some tests that we have done and their results . Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes this paper and presents some perspectives for our futur work.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Related work} \label{sec:related}


Numerous studies have been made in the area of EMG. Authors in ~\cite{Hamdi} showed that the EMG allows to measure the facial electrical activity of muscles via electrodes placed on the face, this measure can be used for expressions recognition. From this facial expressions we can distinguish a stress which causes an increase muscular activity and many others expressions as negative valence, lack of motivation,.etc. \par

Its approach consists to realise an immersive simulation platform for job interviews, which is based on a set of sensors which are used to acquire physiological signals (EMG, ECG,.etc). These signals are processed as follows (extraction, characteristics, classification and performance evaluation of classifiers). The purpose of this platform is to improve the candidate's behavioral skills and training him to manage his emotional state by using the data that is gathered from him.\par

The system can give a misinterpretation of the user's face, but in general it remains a good work that brings a new solution that did not exist before, which can be very handy if some improvements were added.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The EMG signal can enable better monitoring of the contraction's evolution during the pregnancy~\cite{Chendab} .\par Indeed, the precocious detection of premature birth is the key of prevention. The treatment method of EMG uterine for detecting and identifying the pertinent events is based on the wavelet packets.
The author propose two approaches for an EMG uterine decomposition, discrete wavelet decomposition which consists to decompose the EMG signal according to the scale levels. this scale interprets any change in frequency or energy signal. And the second approach is the wavelet packet decomposition which is based on the construction of sub-basic functions organized into packets.
These approachs permit to choose the most pertinent packages for the good detection and classification of an EMG uterine. Furthermore, we can use other types of frequency wavelet that are more selective.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Several methods in ~\cite{huet} are successively applied on the EMG signals so it can be interpreted. The important step is to extract the most discriminative features. Then, various types of classifiers may be used, each one of them presents advantages and disadvantages. None of them for the moment won unanimously. The objective of these classifiers is to choose a reliable and fast learning mechanism, a way to be adapted to control a hand prosthesis.\par

These classifiers are poorly adapted to the changes of the signals occurring from different operators over the time.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Author in ~\cite{LeCarpentier} treat the problem of EMG signal decomposition based on the observation from a single sensor. According to it and to ~\cite{DeLuca}, the decomposition consists in the restitution of pulse train for each motor unit corresponding, and enables the subsequent analysis of muscle motor units proprieties, providing an interpretation of the neural roles in the muscle. The decomposition process is performed in two steps: pretreatment for segmenting the EMG signal and provide an approximation of the shapes of elementary waves, followed by a "Bayesian decomposition" that use the stochastic simulation approach, (MCMC).
The strength of this solution is that, unlike existing methods, no human manipulation is involved in this process, both steps are fully automatic. This work is bringing a new solution, however it lacks a technical implementation in addition to simulation that has been achieved.\par%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Authors in ~\cite{Artemiadis} propose a new method that allow users to control an anthropomorphic robot arm in a 3D space, by developing an interface between the user and the robot arm which is controlled by EMG signals. The efficacy of this proposition is that the experiments are done in real time, including random arm motions with variable hand speed profiles, and those arm motions are not affected by EMG changes with respect to time, and that is done by using a switching model in such a way that it compensated for the EMG changes. This solution is very convenient but the only problem is that the use of robots is not within the reach of everyone and it can be very expensive.\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Studies in~\cite{Zhang} describes a new hand gesture recognition system based on both multi-channel surface EMG sensors and 3D ACC (accelerometer) to realize a flexible interaction between human and computers. The set of defined hand gestures include both finger actions and circular hand movements of various orientations. To evaluate their system they implemented an application that allow to control Virtual Rubik's Cube game. This work is very interesting because it combines two sensing techniques for hand gestures recognition, thus, precision and efficiency are enhanced. However, this application is not that practical for people whom cannot move their hands in a proper way (circular movements of various orientations).\par
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Authors in~\cite{Atieh} propose an interface of "control command" between the prosthetic hand and the human. The human communicates with the prosthetic by sending commands "to keep a hand open, to keep pincer position, keep a encompassing entry position,..etc. On the other hand, the prosthetic hand communicates with the human by displaying messages that are:\par
Send error messages (when the system does not know the signal value). Raise an alarm in case of fatigue. View the status of the battery.\par
This solution allows creation of a simple and useful prosthetic hand which is easy to use. But the main problems that we can encounter, is when error messages are displayed on the screen in the case of a co-contraction (contraction of two muscles in the same time), when the prosthetic receives an unknown signal, and when the amplitude of the signal does not indicate a weak nor a strong contraction (between the two).\par
In addition this solution is not optimal nor flexible because when we want to move from an encompassing state to a pinching state , we have to go through an open state.\par
Finally, this work has not been implemented yet, so we cannot know what technical problems that can be encountered. \par

In this paper, we aim to develop an application that control set of medias by using EMG signal with hand force. The electrical potential generated during a contraction of muscles arm permit to switch between this set of medias. Our proposed system has developed in the purpose of helping person with reduced mobility. \par

\section{Proposed Approach} \label{sec:proposedapproach}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The control strategies of the application use three electrodes placed on the skin surface overlying the
muscles of the arm in order to gather the EMG signals. In this section we will explain the signal processing in details and then the implementation of the system.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Herein, we present the analysis of the EMG data that we have achieved on the data collected from the arm muscle by three surface electrodes placed on the skin.\par
The EMG signals acquired from muscles require advanced methods for processing which are as follows (loading, rectification, filter, linear envelope and fourier transform) showed in figure~\ref{fig:struct}. The purpose of this treatment is to turn the signals into a usable form  for registration or correlation purposes.\par

\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Figures/fig0.png}
    \caption{EMG signal processing diagram}
    \label{fig:struct}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Loading the EMG data} \label{sub:LoadingtheEMGdata}\par
this step is a presentation of the data without processing, except an amplification of the signal that can be added by the electrode. The raw signal is presented in figure~ \ref{fig:data} in this graph we can see the highest peak which represents a muscle contraction that have a value comprised between (30 and 240) and 30 represents the muscle rest period.\par

\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \hspace*{1.2 cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{Figures/data1.eps}
    \caption{EMG Data}
    \label{fig:data}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Rectification of the EMG signal} \label{sub:RectificationtheEMGsignal}\par
a full rectification generates the absolute value of EMG signal. Two phases can be distinguished to obtain the rectified signal as follows: eliminate the shift signal and calculate the absolute value of the signal. the results are showed in figure~\ref{fig:rect}, 
we see that the value of each peak is lower than the previous step.\par

\begin{figure}
    \hspace*{1.2 cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{Figures/rect1.eps}
    \caption{the EMG signal Rectification}
    \label{fig:rect}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Filter and Linear envelope of the EMG signal } \label{sub:LinearenvelopeoftheEMGsignal}\par
filtering the signal serve to eliminate unwanted noise, there are three types of noise in the EMG signal which are, \par
Bio-electric noise: that produced by biological functions like, heartbeat, breathing, blood flow velocity and measured skin temperatures, this noise can be minimized with good placement of the electrode and high quality instruments.\par

Equipment noise: movement of the cable connecting the electrode to the amplifier and the interface between the detection surface of the electrode and the skin creates motion artifacts. Muscle fibers generate electric activity whenever muscles are active. This noise can be reduced by using high quality electronic components and by low pass filter at 20 Hz.\par

The outside noise: it represent all electrical and electromagnetic interference. It can be minimized with a grounding (GND).\par

Filter reduces the amplitude of the signal at a given frequency (cutoff frequency), we have used a butter low pass filter for our treatment of EMG signal (a butter filter is a type of linear filter is designed to obtain a constant gain as possible in its bandwidth). The results achieved by using the following equation :

      [b,a]=butter(n,w,ftype)

      [b,a]= Transfer function coefficients of the filter, returned as row vectors
      n = Filter order
      w= cutoff frequency/sampling frequency
      ftype= Filter type


The cutoff frequency low-pass is often set at around 250 Hz for surface electrode, the linear envelope is the result of a full rectification and low-pass filtering at sampling frequency 1000 Hz, the filter of order 5 and filter type is 'low' we can see the results in figure~\ref{fig:env}, 
we note a decrease in the amplitude of the signal through the filter and the shape of the signal resembles the curve voltage through the linear envelope.\par

\begin{figure}
    \hspace*{1.2 cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{Figures/filter1.eps}
    \caption{Linear envelope & low-pass filter}
    \label{fig:env}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fourier Transform (FFT) of the EMG signals} \label{sub:FourierTransform(FFT)oftheEMGsignals}\par 
the power distribution of the EMG signal can be calculated by the “Fast Fourier Transformation” (FFT) and graphically presented as a total power
spectrum of the EMG signal in figure~\ref{fig:spectre}, which shows the frequency power distribution (Y-axis) in ratio to the amplitude (X-axis), the surface EMG frequency power is located between 0 and 200 Hz as we can see in the graph. The purpose of this treatment step is to analyse muscle fatigue.\par

\begin{figure}
    \hspace*{1.2 cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.40]{Figures/fft1.eps}
    \caption{Power Spectrum}
    \label{fig:spectre}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The user of the application should place three electrodes in his arm, which consists to acquire and amplifie the EMG signal gathered from muscles. 
The signal is processed and filtered, then during a contraction, we can find different values depending to the strength of the contraction. 
First to show the contractions to the user we have used a "LED", which turns "ON" in case of a contraction, and "OFF" otherwise.\par
Then we developed a basic mediaplayer, controlled by the same principle of the LED with just one command allowing to star a media. In other words
when the user make a contraction, there is signal sent into the application and get started the media.
Figure~\ref{fig:example} show an exemple of use of the application. \par
\par
Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} shows the architecture of our system:

\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.23]{Figures/architecture.eps}
    \caption{System architecture}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}
 
\begin{figure}[!hb]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{Figures/app2.png}
    \caption{Example of use case}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
So here the user launches the command to start the media, 
we can see also the different components of the interface : a progress bar and an LCDNumber for displaying the signal strength of the user, 
a button to choose the media, and the media viewer.\par

To enhance the application and to make it more flexibale and useful, we have added a lot of options. So first, we have done studies on some existing 
methods allowing an intuitive detection of the location of electrodes and their adaptation with the arm of the user. This step is very important, because The 
shape and the amplitude of the EMG signal are influenced by the location of the electrodes. Therefore the amplitude of the recorded signal decreases 
exponentially with respect to the distance between the electrodes and the source of electrical activity. This required setting up a correction method to 
simplify the eletrodes placement, in our case we opted for clustering algorithmes (K-means).\par
The users (man, woman and child) do not have the same EMG signals strength, in addition it may be that the same user does not have the same force when he is
fit and when he is tired. Which requires a learning phase that permits the adaptation of the strength threshold with the proper user. So the user -before 
commanding the application- has to do some tests in order to know to which cluster he belongs. In this phase we also used k-means for the classifiction of
the individual. And, once the category of the user is determined, the system adapts the threshold according to the user.\par
Then, several fonctionalities were added, like stop media, change it, come back to the previous one,.etc, while, at the same time, keeping the user-friendly side of the system. 
Thus, creating other commands was realised according to three parameters : "Force", "Timing" and "Contraction frequency". So in our application we need to 
create four commands, C1 : to start the first media or to get the following ones, C2 : to return to the previous media, C3: to pause the media or to continue,
C4 : to stop the media.

\begin{table}[h]
    \hspace*{0 cm}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.50]{Figures/Tableau.eps}
    \caption{Commands classification}
    \label{tab:classification}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:classification} shows the combination of different parameters allowing the creation of new commands. Where the Force can take two values 
"Strong" and "Weak", the Timing can take two intervales "[0,T[" and "[T,+inf[" where T is the time (in seconds) of maintaining the contraction, and F1, F2 are
respectively Frequency = 1 and Frequency = 2. We have defined "t" the maximum period between two frequencies to make the difference
between "one command with two frequencies" and between "two different commands", "t" hase been defined based on many tests (detailed on ~\ref{tab:experimentalResearch}).
With this combination of parameters, we have created four commands (six fonctionalities) without any ambiguity.
So we can interpret the table as follows : C1(Start|Next) =  W + <T, C2(Previous
) = (2W|2S|S+W)+(<T|T>) which "|" means "or", C3(Pause|Continue) = W + >T, Finally C4(Stop) = S + >T.\par
Then, for a more simplicity, especially for people who cannot move their fingers, we can use a dynamic media list, by creating a file or a database containing
links (URLs) downloaded and updated automatically from the Internet.\par
Finally, we made our tests by using wired electrodes that will be replaced later by wireless electrodes, which gives more flexibility, 
light weight and robustness to our system.\par



\section{Experimental researches} \label{sec:experimentalResearch}
In our application, we have used 3 modules: Gui for building the graphical interface, Core module which contains core non-GUI functionalities and finaly,
phonon module for multimedia applications.
To understand the application's architecture, the following class diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:diagram}) models the multimedia application structure. 
The "main" class is associated with the "QApplication" and the "control" class which inherits from the "QObject" and is associated with the "QSerialPort"
and the "Thread" classes. The "Thread" class inherits from the "QWidget" class and is associated with the "QThread" and the "scene" classes. Finaly, the 
"scene" class inherits from the "Ui::scene" and the "QMainWindow" classes  and is associated with the "phonon" and the "multimedia" classes .

\section{Conclusion and futur works} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this paper, we proposed an approach to control a media player by using the EMG signals. Before exploiting the EMG signals,
it has to go through some specific processing steps in order to have better results. The approach is designed to provide a control interface
destined especially for people with reduced mobility. 
Thus we have done a real implementation of the application. To create commands, we have combinated different parameters in order to get a performed
interface without any ambiguity on controling it. 
Our experimental results show that this proposed approach realises an intuitive and user-friendly human machine interface, and it is able to achieve a
good performance. Our future work will focus on the adaptation of this remote on handling multiple applications at once, such as controlling a TV,
turn ON and OFF the light of the room, start the robotic vacuum cleaner,.etc, while, at the same time, keeping the flexibility of the system.
